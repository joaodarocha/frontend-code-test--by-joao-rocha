# Frontend Technical Test

## Made with üíö by [Jo√£o Rocha](mailto:joaorocha@gmail.com)

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
We have a high focus on attention to details in code

* The formatting of the codebase should be consistent and written in a modular approach
* The solution should be structured appropriately for enterprise scale development
* We expect the data from the two API calls to be retrieved and merged efficiently using appropriate RxJS operators
* We expect the codebase to be written using ES6+ and libraries kept to a minimum
* We expect the code to be written with performance in mind
* We expect you to create an appropriate level of automated test coverage
* We expect to see a best practice approach to error handling
* We prefer native Browser Api over JS libraries
* Mobile-first development approach using min-width media queries
* Solution should be accessible and meet WCAG 2.1
* No CSS framework allowed
* Internally, we use BEM - but we are open to other CSS naming conventions as long as it's built with scale and maintenance in mind

We have a high focus on attention to details in design

* We expect the designs to match as closely as possible, ready for a designer to review
* Correct semantic HTML mark-up and/or CSS should be used to achieve the size and aspect ratio of the images in the design
* Interactions and animations to be considered but not distracting users away from the experience
* Minimal visual bugs when going resizing to mobile and large screen sizes

## ‚úçÔ∏è Proposed Solution

- we can achieve the desired designs by breaking them in the following components:
  - CardComponent
  - CardListComponent
- CardService: to fetch data from the API
